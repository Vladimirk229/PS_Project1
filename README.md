This project was the most challenging thing I ever did for Per Scholas. First of all, I tried to do this with regular DOM manipulations but then decided to do that with React which was very hard as it's a first React project I've made. Through the process I faced various problems, like basic React syntax, fetching data using API, visualising data, correct stying and many other issues. The last challenge was to deploy the application which was pretty easy, especially comparing with development process. If I had more time, I would add information about neighbours (I had unexplainable issues with that, and failed to fetch data about neigbours, despite fetching data about everything else), also it would be nice to make this app as a map where you click on a country on a world map and it shows you a country card with all information about it, maybe wiith links to wikipedia. Still, this project was pretty fun despite taking too much time.
